# ID3 Decision Tree Learning Algorithm

This is a basic implementation of ID3 Decision Tree Learning Algorithm with error-reduced pruning from gound up. 

```python
parse.py
```
takes a filename and returns attribute information and all the data in array of dictionaries

To test all functions, run:
```python
unit_tests.py
```

To plot the learning curves with and without pruning, run:
```python
plot.py
```
